This is a full fledged Android App developed for my final year undergraduate project. 
It is medical diagnosis app that guesses the disease based on the symptoms selected by the user. 
It can also give information about specific disease, first aid information and provide emergency services.
It has an AI enabled melanoma detector built in too.
It can also provide you with the latest medical news and provide details and contact information about the nearest hospitals based on your location.
It also has provision to store your medical reports safely on the cloud and protected by your fingerprint.
It can also be used a reminder app to take medicines on time.
