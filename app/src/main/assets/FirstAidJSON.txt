If gloves are not available, use many layers of clean cloth, plastic bags, or the cleanest material available between your hands and the wound.\n\t\t\t\t\t•\tHave the injured person lie down and elevate the site that is bleeding.\n\t\t\t\t\t•\tRemove any visible objects in the wound that are easy to remove, and remove or cut clothing from around the wound.\n\t\t\t\t\t•\tApply steady direct pressure for a full 15 minutes.

          "content": "•\tMedicines that are available fall into two general categories. One category includes medications that are meant to control asthma in the long term and are used daily to prevent asthma attacks (controller medications). These can include inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled cromolyn or nedocromil, long-acting bronchodilators, theophylline, and leukotriene antagonists. The other category is medications that provide instant relief from symptoms (rescue medications). These include short-acting bronchodilators like albuterol. Systemic corticosteroids, like prednisone or methylprednisolone (Medrol), are used for severe persistent symptoms for a short course of treatment, but these medications can take hours, or even days, to become effective. Inhaled ipratropium may be used in addition to inhaled albuterol following asthma attacks or when asthma worsens. It's important to understand the difference between controller and rescue medications and to use them appropriately.\n\n\t\t\t•\tIn general, doctors start with a high level of therapy following an asthma attack and then decrease treatment to the lowest possible level that still prevents asthma attacks and allows your child to have a normal life. Every child needs to follow a customized asthma management plan to control asthma symptoms. The severity of a child's asthma can both worsen and improve over time, so the type (category) of your child's asthma can change, which means different treatment can be required over time. Treatment should be reviewed every 1-6 months, and the choices for long- and short-term therapy are based on how severe the asthma is.\n\n\t\t\t•\tTalk to your doctor about the various medications available to treat asthma."

Sometimes, it literally causes it to move around in your head. Traumatic brain injuries can cause bruising, damage to the blood vessels, and injury to the nerves.\n\n\tThe result? Your brain doesn't function normally. If you've suffered a concussion, vision may be disturbed, you may lose equilibrium, or you may fall unconscious. In short, the brain is confused.

There are many possible causes for constipation, including:\n\t\t\t•\tWithholding stool. This means that your child is trying to hold his bowel movements in -- maybe because he’s stressed about potty training, maybe because he doesn’t want to use the toilet in certain places (like school), or maybe because he’s afraid of a painful bathroom experience. (Constipation can become a vicious cycle -- if it hurts to “poop” once, the child may be more fearful of going the next time.)\n\t\t\t•\tA diet that’s low in fiber or doesn’t include enough liquids (or both)\n\t\t\t•\tSide effects of certain medications"

          "heading": "Constipation Treatments",
          "content": "\tThere are three primary treatments for most cases of constipation, and they usually work hand-in-hand:\n\t\t\t•\tA stool softener to clear the bowels. These are safe in children, but should be used under the supervision of your pediatrician.\n\n\tTwo common mistakes that parents make when giving their child a stool softener for constipation is not using a large enough dose, or stopping it too soon. For example, you might think that you can stop giving a stool softener after your child’s first normal-looking bowel movement, but stopping too soon may just set your child up for another bout of constipation. Some children may need to stay on a stool softener for a few weeks. Your doctor can advise you on the right dosing schedule for your child.\n\t\t\t•\tA high-fiber diet with plenty of fluids. This means loading your child’s plate with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, high-fiber cereals, whole grain breads (look for at least 3-5 grams of fiber per serving), and a variety of pageBeans and other legumes, like chickpeas and lentils. Two good sources of fiber that kids are often happy to eat are trail mix (let them make their own) and popcorn with minimal salt or butter. Foods containing probiotics, like yogurt, can also promote good digestive health.\n\n\tWhile focusing on fiber, don’t forget fluids. If your child is eating plenty of high-fiber food but not getting enough fluid to help flush it through his system, you can make matters worse. Your child should be drinking plenty of water throughout the day, along with some milk. Limit sugary drinks to 4 ounces a day in younger children and 6-8 ounces in school-aged kids.\n\t\t\t•\tRegular toilet time. Encourage your child to use the toilet first thing in the morning and after every meal or snack. Particularly for a younger child, you may get better results by telling, not asking. Instead of suggesting, “Do you need to go to the bathroom?” simply say, “Time to go to the bathroom now.”\n\n\tYou’ll get the best results if you combine all three of these approaches. A high-fiber diet isn’t likely to clear up a serious case of constipation on its own without the help of a stool softener; on the other hand, once your child stops taking a stool softener, if he stays on a low-fiber diet and doesn’t get enough healthy fluids, the problem is likely to happen again."

          "content": "\tHaving something stuck in your ear can be painful. It can also be dangerous -- potentially causing hearing loss, bleeding, infection, even damage to the eardrum.\n\tBabies and young children are known to put small objects in their ears like candy, pageBeans, and rocks, and insects like cockroaches, moths, and flies are also known to crawl into the ears of adults and kids.\n\tRegardless of what’s in the ear, it’s important to get it out as quickly as possible. Here are some important steps to follow:\n\t•\tTry to see if the object will fall out simply by tilting your child’s head.\n\t•\tIf you can see the object in the ear and think you can remove it easily, carefully pull it out with a pair of tweezers. Be careful not to push it in deeper, and don’t poke at the ear or try to remove the object by force. The ear canal is very sensitive, and this could be painful.\n\t•\tIf it is a live insect, kill it before you try to remove it. Put a few drops of warm (not hot) baby oil or vegetable oil in the ear. Have your child tilt and gently shake his head to dislodge the bug. Don't use this method for anything other than an insect, and don't use it if your child is in pain, the ear is bleeding, or if he has tubes in his ear.\n\t•\tIf you’re sure the eardrum isn’t injured and your child doesn’t have tubes in his ear, try washing the object out with a little warm water.\n\n\tYou should see your doctor immediately if you can’t easily get the object out by yourself, or if parts of it remain in the ear. You should also get medical help if there’s pain, hearing loss, or discomfort after the object is removed."

If you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, ask your doctor to recommend a product that’s safe to use.\n\n\tOver-the-counter products only kill live lice, not their eggs (nits). You apply two treatments – about 7 to 9 days apart -- to prevent adult lice from laying new eggs.\n\n\tOver-the-counter lice treatments have these active ingredients:\n\t\t•\tPiperonyl butoxide with pyrethrins (Rid, Triple X, Pronto, R&C, A-200): You can use this treatment in kids ages 2 years and older. It’s made from the chrysanthemum flower. Don’t use it if you have an allergy to chrysanthemums (mums) or ragweed.\n\t\t•\tPermethrin lotion, 1% (Nix): This lice shampoo is approved for use in babies and children ages 2 months and older.\n\n\tDon’t use more than the recommended amount or combine different products. If you still see lice moving after using an over-the-counter treatment, call a doctor. You may need a stronger product.\n\n\tPrescription lice treatments include:\n\t\t•\tBenzyl alcohol (Ulesfia): This lotion kills active lice, not eggs. It can be used to treat head lice in children ages 6 months and older, and is safe for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. You comb the hair first, shampoo the product into dry hair, and let it sit for about 10 minutes before rinsing. You need to repeat this treatment in a week.\n\t\t•\tIvermectin (Sklice): This lotion kills most head lice, even just-hatched lice, with just one use. You don’t need to comb out lice eggs (nits) and you don’t need to treat a second time. Children ages 6 months and older can use this product.\n\t\t•\tMalathion (Ovide): This very strong lotion paralyzes and kills lice and some lice eggs. It’s approved for use in kids ages 6 years and older. If you still see lice moving 7 to 9 days later, you’ll need a second treatment. Warning: The product is flammable. Avoid all cigarettes and heat sources, including blow dryers, curling irons, lighters, fireplaces, space heaters, and stoves. Using them at the same time can start a fire.\n\t\t•\tSpinosad (Natroba): You usually only need one treatment with this product. It kills nits and live lice. It’s safe for use on kids ages 4 years and older.\n\n\tLidane shampoo is also FDA-approved to treat lice. But the American Academy of Pediatrics no longer recommends its use because it has been linked to nervous system damage.\n\n\tKeep these tips in mind when using lice treatments:\n\t\t•\tAlways follow the product instructions carefully.\n\t\t•\tUse a fine-tooth comb or the lice comb that came with the product to comb out all nits. (Some prescription products don’t require combing.)\n\t\t•\tIf you’re using a lice shampoo, be sure to apply it over a sink or tub while you and your child are fully dressed. Don’t use the product while showering. You want to limit how much of it touches your body.\n\n\tThe most common side effect of lice treatments is skin irritation. They may cause a temporary burning or stinging of the skin."

Lice and lice eggs (nits) die when exposed to temperatures greater than 128.3°F for more than 5 minutes.

Although it is rarely a serious disease to otherwise healthy children, the symptoms last about 2 weeks and can make the child very uncomfortable. In addition, chickenpox can be a serious illness in people with weak immune systems, such as newborns, people on chemotherapy for cancer, people taking steroids, pregnant women, or those with HIV. A safe and effective vaccine is now available to children aged 1 year or older to prevent chickenpox. It takes 10-20 days to develop chickenpox after being exposed to the virus by inhaling infected droplets or coming in direct contact with the lesions on an infected person.\n\n\t•\tSymptoms\n\t\t•\tThe symptoms of chickenpox often begins with a very itchy rash, which first appears on the scalp, armpits, or groin area and progresses, in intervals, to spread over the entire body.\n\t\t•\tThe rash begins as an area of redness with a small, superficial blister in the center. The blister eventually ruptures with some possible drainage, and the lesion will then form a crust.\n\t\t•\tOther associated symptoms include fever, malaise, sore throat, and red eyes. Fever and malaise may precede the rash in some cases.\n\n\t•\tTreatment\n\t\t•\tThe virus is spread primarily from the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth of the child, but the rash itself is also contagious. The child remains contagious and cannot go to school or daycare until the last lesion has appeared and is fully crusted over.\n\t\t•\tNo therapy treats chickenpox once it has begun, but your doctor can provide prescriptions and advice to help with the discomfort and the itching.\n\t\t•\tNever give aspirin to a child in general but especially one with chickenpox. A deadly disease called Reye syndrome has been associated with children taking aspirin, especially if they have chickenpox. Be sure to check the contents of any other over-the-counter medications for aspirin or salicylates because these are often found mixed with over-the-counter cold medications.\n\t\t•\tChickenpox can occasionally affect the cornea, the clear front portion of the eye. If your child develops chickenpox on the tip of the nose or in the eyes, see your doctor immediately.\n\t\t•\tSee a doctor immediately also if yours child develops in the genital regions internally or inside of the mouth."
