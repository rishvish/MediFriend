People with generalized anxiety disorder often feel anxious for no apparent reason. They also may feel tired, restless, irritable, short of breath, have difficulty concentrating or sleeping, or have a racing heartbeat. Doctors aren't sure what causes generalized anxiety disorder, but it can run in families. Stressful life situations also may cause the disorder. It can start anytime in life, even in childhood. Medications and psychotherapy, along with lifestyle changes, can help."

Calcium is important for healthy bones and teeth, but also for blood clotting and nerve and muscle functions. Severe hypocalcemia can lead to cardiovascular collapse and low blood pressure that doesn't respond to treatment. Kidney failure, low levels of vitamin D or magnesium, some medication and blood disorders, chemotherapy, alcoholism, and underactive parathyroid glands can cause it. You may have symptoms such as tingling, muscle spasms and aches, and confusion. Raising your calcium levels, sometime intravenously, will clear it up. Death from hypocalcemia is very rare."

With mild hypocalcemia, you may have numbness and tingling around your mouth or in your fingers and toes and be depressed and irritable. With severe hypocalcemia, you may be confused and disoriented. Your heart muscles may contract irregularly because of electrolyte imbalance. For chronic hypocalcemia, calcium and vitamin D supplements probably will be enough to bring your calcium levels back up. But if you have symptoms, you'll be given calcium intravenously and vitamin D supplements to help with its absorption. Your doctor may treat the underlying cause of the problem if it can be identified."

People with panic disorder have sudden attacks of terror that may include rapid heartbeat, sweating, dizziness, light-headedness, tingling hands, nausea, and chest pain. Because symptoms come on without any warning, people with panic disorder sometimes try to avoid situations or places they associate with feelings of panic. When fear of having a panic attack becomes so intense that the person rarely leaves the house, it's considered agoraphobia. Agoraphobia can make it difficult to hold down a job and makes the person very dependent on others. Depression, alcoholism, or drug abuse often occur with panic disorder. No one knows what causes panic disorders, but they tend to run in families. Antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, and therapy help treat panic disorder and agoraphobia."

In the country, it occurs rarely, primarily in long-term alcoholics and people whose bodies don't convert tryptophan well. Though it can be fatal if not treated, bed rest, niacin supplements, and a high-protein diet clear it up."

If you develop glossitis, your tongue may swell and turn bright red. In the early stages of pellagra, you may be depressed, lethargic, and apathetic, and have trouble concentrating. As the disease advances, you may become confused, forgetful, and disoriented, have hallucinations, and go into a coma. Vitamin therapy with oral niacin or nicotinamide, a component of the B-complex vitamins, helps clear up pellagra.

Partial or focal seizures cause small, repetitive movements from lip smacking to head tilting along with other symptoms such as hallucinations. Generalized tonic-clonic or grand mal seizures cause a person to cry out, fall down, lose consciousness, and have violent muscle contractions, which cause incontinence and convulsions. Epilepsy can affect anyone and usually has no clear cause. Stroke, brain injury, brain illness or infection, brain tumors, birth defects of the brain, certain diseases, and kidney or liver failure can also cause epilepsy.

The symptoms may go away or let up after weeks or months, and you're able to resume normal activities. If they don't go away or if they resurface in stressful situations, you may have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). You could have nightmares or flashbacks, feel emotionally numb or vulnerable, have attention or memory deficits, or other symptoms that affect your relationships or work. A therapist who is experienced in treating trauma can help you deal with thoughts, feelings, and behaviors resulting from trauma with counseling or medication."

If you're not sure how serious a head injury is, don't go to sleep for at least 12 hours so that you can be alert to changes in mental status.\n\nFor strains, bumps, and bruises, use the RICE method: Rest the area, apply ice for 15 minutes at a time to reduce swelling, compress by wrapping in an Ace or other bandage, and elevate to reduce blood flow to the area.\n\nTo stop bleeding, apply firm but gentle pressure, using a clean cloth or gauze, for 10 minutes. If blood soaks through the gauze, add another piece of gauze on top of the first and continue to apply pressure.\n\nImmerse a burn in cool water for 15 minutes or until pain subsides. Apply antibiotic cream and cover with a sterile, nonstick dressing.\n\nFor open wounds, clean well with warm water and soap, apply antibiotic cream or ointment, and cover with a sterile dressing.\n\nThese self-care strategies may help symptoms of emotional trauma:\n\t\t•\tGive yourself time to heal.\n\t\t•\tAvoid making major life decisions until you heal.\n\t\t•\tJoin a support group for people who have been through a similar type of trauma.\n\t\t•\tCommunicate your feelings to a trusted friend or family member, or keep a diary.\n\t\t•\tEstablish or reestablish routines such as regular times for sleeping, eating, exercising, relaxing, and hobbies.\n\t\t•\tKeep healthy to cope better.

Ketoacidosis happens most often in people with type 1 diabetes. Being sick, missing an insulin dose, not eating well, heart attack, stroke, alcohol abuse, or even stress may trigger it. If you develop ketoacidosis, you may be very thirsty and nauseated. You'll need to be treated in the hospital with IV fluids containing insulin and electrolytes.

Children with Asperger's syndrome usually have normal to superior intelligence. Unlike children with autism, they don't have delayed cognitive or language development. But they can have odd speech patterns, great difficulties with socializing and communication, and obsessive-compulsive traits. People are born with Asperger syndrome, and research suggests that it may run in families. Though the social impairments of Asperger's syndrome are believed to be lifelong, educational and social support helps many children go on to lead independent lives."

This could evolve into trouble pedaling, catching, or climbing. Obsessive interest in a single topic or object is one of the main characteristics of Asperger's syndrome. For example, a child may spend hours counting passing cars or will only talk about trains. Your child will have difficulty with social interaction, and may be rigid and resist change. Your child may be exceptionally skilled in some areas, such as with numbers, math, computers, or music. A child or adolescent psychiatrist can diagnose your child and work with you to develop an effective program to help him or her. There is no specific way to deal with Asperger's syndrome, but most treatment combines psychotherapy, special education, behavior modification, and support for parents. Medication is sometimes recommended. With good, early help, many children are able to cope with disabilities caused by Asperger's syndrome and go on to college and careers. Your child may continue to need support throughout life to deal with the challenges of social and personal relationships."

Then the lower chambers contract and pump blood to the rest of the body. With a normal heartbeat, contractions follow in order, and both the upper and lower chambers work at the same pace.

Strokes are also a potential problem. So you may need to take blood thinners on a regular basis to prevent them.

Young children normally explore and put things in their mouth, such as crayons. However, pica occurs when a child or an adult is compelled to eat non-food repeatedly for at least a month. Children with developmental disabilities such as mental retardation or autism are more likely to develop the condition. Not getting enough iron or other nutrients also may cause pica. People with pica may crave and eat non-food items such as dirt, feces, string, paint chips, laundry detergent, and coffee grounds. Pica can be harmless or quite serious. Bowel obstruction, lead poisoning, parasite infection, or viral illness can occur, depending on what items are eaten. The condition often goes away on its own in a few months. In some people, pica can be a lifelong problem, especially if it occurs along with a developmental disability. Treatment may involve behavioral therapy, medication, and teaching parents how to prevent non-food eating in children."

They can also be spread by using combs, brushes, bedding, or towels from an infected person. While they're small, you can see white lice eggs, called nits, in the hair around the neck and ears. Nits look like dandruff but stay firmly attached to the hair. Lice are harder to spot unless there are a lot of them. Over-the-counter or prescription shampoos and combing hair with a special nit comb will treat head lice."

It causes mood swings such as depression, anger, irritability, and tension that are significant enough to interfere with work, school, relationships, and social life. PMDD affects a small percentage of women. The causes are not fully known, but stress, hormonal changes, vulnerability in brain chemistry, and fluctuation of the brain chemical serotonin may play a part. Medications, counseling, nutritional strategies, and lifestyle changes can help improve symptoms."

			"heading": "What to Expect",

During the days before your period, you may have anger that seems out of control or you feel overwhelmed or hopeless. You may lose interest in social activities or work and have trouble concentrating. Physical symptoms such as bloating and headache may also occur. When your period starts, the symptoms begin to decrease. If the symptoms appear during other times in your cycle, PMMD is probably not the cause. If your PMDD is mild, you may be able to manage it with regular exercise, stress-reduction techniques, and changes in diet. If your symptoms don't improve or if you have severe symptoms, your doctor may suggest an antidepressant, usually a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Psychological counseling and other medications, including hormonal therapies, can also ease PMDD symptoms. Give your treatment two or three menstrual cycles to see if your symptoms improve before talking with your doctor about a different approach."

It's brought on by changes of head position that cause a sudden sense of spinning, known as vertigo. The dizziness comes from shifts in calcium crystals in the inner ear that normally help the brain know where you are in relation to things around you. Normally, these crystals send signals to the brain that help you balance. But with BPPV the signals are exaggerated. The result is a sensation that either you or the room is spinning. BPPV may be due to labyrinthitis, an inflammation or viral infection in parts of the inner ear. Most often, its cause is unknown. Along with the sensation of spinning, or vertigo, BPPV may cause nausea and sometimes vomiting."

Changing your head position can bring it on or make the symptoms worse. Some people experience the feeling on waking, rolling over, or getting out of bed. During an episode, driving or operating machinery can be dangerous. Often, the BPPV improves on its own with no treatment over a period of a few weeks to a few months. Treating it with medications used for motion sickness can help relieve the symptoms. Slow rotational head movements and other exercises that you can learn from a physical therapist or other health professional can also be effective in controlling symptoms.

A leaky aortic valve can also be caused by infection, calcium deposits on the valve, or a bicuspid valve. Symptoms of aortic regurgitation typically develop over time.

Blood pressure is measured by two numbers, for example, 140/90. The top number is called systolic pressure and measures the pressure when the heart beats. The bottom number is called diastolic pressure and measures the pressure as the heart rests between beats. A person has high blood pressure if the top number is 140 or higher or if the bottom number is 90 or higher. In most cases, there's no one cause of primary high blood pressure. High blood pressure often happens with age. Other risk factors are being overweight, having a family history, heavy drinking, lack of exercise, poor diet, and other factors. Primary hypertension often develops over years. Secondary hypertension is caused by an underlying condition such as kidney problems, some medications, and tumors on the adrenal glands. Left untreated, high blood pressure can damage the heart, arteries, and kidneys and greatly increase the risk for stroke and heart attack. Eating a healthy, low-salt diet, getting regular exercise, quitting smoking, staying at a healthy weight, and taking medication can lower blood pressure to a healthy range."

The virus infects the brain and nervous system, causing anxiety, excitability, fever, loss of muscle control, muscle spasms, drooling, and convulsions. Once symptoms occur, the virus can't be cured, and the infected person usually dies in about 7 days. Prompt treatment with a rabies vaccine can prevent symptoms and treat the infection. Foxes, skunks, raccoons, bats, and coyotes commonly spread rabies. Domestic animals rarely spread the illness, because most pets get rabies vaccinations. Infected animals often drool, bite, and act either very aggressively or unusually friendly. If you think you have been bitten by an animal infected with rabies, get immediate medical help."

If the rabies test is positive or the animal develops signs of rabies, you will be treated with a rabies vaccine. If not treated, rabies symptoms will occur about 3 to 7 weeks after infection. Early signs include flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, and weakness. There may be a tingling or prickling sensation at the site of the bite. Soon, more serious symptoms develop, including anxiety, excitability, muscle spasms, drooling, and convulsions. Death occurs about 7 days after symptoms develop.

The virus can be passed by sharing drug needles, having sex with an infected person, and sharing personal items such as toothbrushes or razors. A mother can pass the disease to her child at birth. Most people who get the hepatitis B virus fight it off in six months with rest and close monitoring by a doctor. Some people go on to develop chronic hepatitis B, a more serious form of the disease.

Men between ages 20 and 50 are most likely to get pericarditis. Viruses and infection, especially respiratory infection, commonly cause it. Pericarditis usually clears up on its own with rest and minor treatment. In severe cases, surgery is required. Severe untreated pericarditis can lead to fatal complications."

It usually infects the lungs, but it can also affect other areas such as the spine, brain, kidneys, and intestines. TB spreads when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings, which releases droplets into the air that other people can breathe in. If not treated, the disease can be serious and even fatal. TB causes a bad cough, coughing up blood, chest pain, fever, chills, and fatigue. Some people are infected with TB bacteria but don't have any symptoms and are not contagious. However, the disease can become active later and make them sick. People with a weak immune system, such as from HIV, are at higher risk for TB infection. Living in unsanitary conditions, abusing alcohol or drugs, and working with people who have TB also increases the risk. Taking several medications over a period of months will cure most cases of TB unless it's caused by a drug resistant version of the bacterium. Not taking medication correctly increases the risk of developing treatment-resistant TB."

Some people with TB never get sick at all, some develop symptoms a few weeks after infection, and others develop the illness years later. Once the disease becomes active, symptoms such as fatigue, fever, weight loss, and cough may develop. Without treatment, symptoms can get worse or the infection may spread to other parts of the body. Everyone who has a TB infection needs treatment, either to prevent TB from becoming active, or to treat active TB.

In rare cases, you can get plague by handling an infected animal. Pneumonic plague (a lung infection) is spread easily between people by coughing. It can cause a high fever, difficulty breathing, seizures, severe headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, organ failure, and bleeding. Plague was a huge problem in the Middle Ages, killing millions of people, but now it is confined mostly to certain parts of the Southwest country where rodents carry the disease.\n\nBubonic plague (confined to the lymph nodes), which also killed million of people in the Middle Ages, is difficult to pass to others."

Years later, the virus may reactivate as shingles. Stress, cancer, or other medical problems can trigger an outbreak. In some cases, shingles pain may linger after the rash has cleared up. This is called post-herpetic neuralgia, a long-lasting, sometimes disabling condition."

Noroviruses are contagious and often cause outbreaks among people who live, work, or eat in close quarters. That's because they are easily spread through contaminated food or water, by touching a contaminated surface, or from person to person. There's no specific treatment for noroviruses, although it's important to get enough fluids. Infants, older adults, and people with chronic illnesses are at higher risk for dehydration from noroviruses and may need medical care."

Falls are a leading cause of injury in children, as well, and can lead to bumps, bruises, cuts, sprains, concussions, and fractures."

Tics can be complex, involving several parts of the body, such as tilting the head, swinging an arm, and jumping up. Or a tic can be simple and more subtle, like sniffing repeatedly. In addition to movements, tics can also include vocalizations, such as grunting. Rarely, a person with Tourette's syndrome may shout out swear words or repeat something another person has said. Stress or certain triggers, such as a tight collar or hearing someone sniff, can make tics worse. This syndrome usually begins in childhood, and boys are affected three times more often than girls.

The first treatment is usually medicated eye drops to lower eye pressure, preventing further nerve damage and vision loss. If this doesn't lower pressure enough, your ophthalmologist may suggest laser treatments, which can help reduce eye pressure for three to five years. In severe cases, you may need surgery to create an alternative channel to drain eye fluid."

How large an area it covers, how much you scratch it, and whether it becomes infected determine the severity of atopic dermatitis. You may be able to clear up a small patch of mild atopic dermatitis just with moisturizing. A large, very itchy, severe patch will need the care of a dermatologist. A skin patch can help determine if a specific allergen or irritant causes it to flare. Atopic dermatitis can go into remission for months or years. Treating it early may make it less severe. Atopic dermatitis may make children restless and irritable. Children may get a rash in the creases of elbows or knees, around the mouth, or on their wrists, neck, or ankles. They may lick their lips a lot if they have inflammation around the mouth, causing painful cracks. In adults, it also can appear in creases, on the face, or as a rash all over the body.

If the cause can be treated, such as some infections or blockage in the nasal passages, anosmia can be relieved. In other cases, particularly if it's caused by age, anosmia may be permanent. Anosmia is not life threatening, but it can affect the quality of your life. You may not be able to taste foods or enjoy pleasant scents. It can also be dangerous because you can't detect smoke, poisonous fumes, or spoiled food. Learning adaptive strategies can help you cope with permanent anosmia."

You may be able to distinguish salty, sweet, sour, or bitter tastes -- which don't rely on sense of smell -- but not other tastes. You may also notice that you can't smell common aromas -- coffee brewing, the onion you're chopping, flowers. Whether you can recover your sense of smell depends partly on the cause. If a nasal or sinus condition causes anosmia, oral or inhaled steroids, antibiotics, decongestants, and other medications may help.\n\nSurgery may clear up anosmia if a polyp or other obstruction in your nose is the cause. If anosmia is caused by a head injury or upper respiratory infection, treatment may not be effective. Permanent anosmia can cause psychological and safety issues. You may feel anxious or depressed or lose interest in eating, which can lead to nutrition problems. Your doctor can advise you on safety measures such as installing smoke and gas detectors. Learning strategies to enhance flavor and improve your enjoyment of eating may also help."

Asbestos fibers lodge in the lungs and cause scarring, which stiffens the lungs and gradually makes breathing more difficult. Asbestosis can lead to cancer and heart or lung failure.

The severity of asbestosis usually depends on how much asbestos you were exposed to and how often. Treatment focuses on alleviating your symptoms. Your doctor may recommend oxygen therapy or an inhaler to thin the secretions in your lungs. In severe cases, a lung transplant may be necessary. Most importantly, if you smoke, you need to stop.

Women may have pregnancy complications, such as high blood pressure and problems during labor and delivery, and your infant is more likely to have a high birth weight and some birth defects. Your children are also more likely to be obese and at risk for type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Obesity commonly causes emotional issues in children and adults, such as depression, low self-esteem, and social isolation.\n\nYour doctor and a dietician can help you develop a realistic plan for healthy weight loss and getting more activity and exercise. Counseling or a weight loss program can provide support and help with emotional aspects of eating, such as knowing when you tend to overeat and developing new habits for those situations. In some cases, your doctor may also prescribe medication for weight loss. Prescription and over-the-counter weight loss products can interact with other medications or produce serious side effects, so use them under a doctor's supervision. If you are very obese or have serious weight-related health problems, weight loss surgery may help. Trying to lose weight can seem hard, but even small lifestyle changes and losing 10 pounds can make you feel better, improve your health, and help prevent health problems."

This procedure must be combined with a low-salt, low-liquid diet, otherwise the fluid will simply come back.\n\nIf these treatments don’t work, you may need a surgery to place a shunt in your liver or replace it altogether."

There are two types of dysmenorrhea: primary and secondary. Primary occurs naturally -- some women just have more painful periods than others. High levels of the hormone prostaglandin are thought to cause painful periods. Secondary dysmenorrhea occurs because of another medical problem such as endometriosis or fibroid tumors. Taking pain relievers and using a heating pad will treat most cases of primary dysmenorrhea. For painful periods due to medical problems, treating the medical problem can relieve symptoms."

High levels of the hormone prostaglandin are thought to cause painful periods. Secondary dysmenorrhea occurs because of another medical problem such as endometriosis or fibroid tumors. Taking pain relievers and using a heating pad will treat most cases of primary dysmenorrhea. For painful periods due to medical problems, treating the medical problem can relieve symptoms."

Many women have gonorrhea and have no symptoms. Symptoms may be mild and include painful urination, vaginal discharge, or bleeding between periods. If not treated, gonorrhea can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Serious complications may occur, including arthritis, skin sores, and inflammation of the brain or liver. Pregnant women with gonorrhea can pass it to their baby during birth, causing eye, joint, and blood infections. About 60% of people with gonorrhea also have chlamydia, another STD. Antibiotics treat and cure gonorrhea."

Antibiotics, injections, and anti-inflammatories are used to treat it, but surgery is the most effective treatment. If you've had acne, you're more likely to get hidradenitis suppurativa.

Within hours or days, the bumps get bigger, become inflamed and painful, and drain pus, which causes scarring. You also may have a foul odor, caused by bacterial infection. If your hidradenitis suppurativa is mild, you can apply warm compresses and wash the area with antibacterial soap to relieve the odor. There are no cures for hidradenitis supporativa. Surgery is the most effective treatment, but it can cause scars and complications, so dermatologists try other treatments first. Injections in the lesions usually reduce swelling and tenderness within days. Oral and topical antibiotics, birth control pills, retinoids, and isotretinoin (used to treat severe acne) may help clear it up. If your condition gets worse over time or you develop scarring, you may need surgery. If you have depression because of chronic pain or disfigurement, it may help to get counseling."

LGV has been uncommon in the U.S. and other industrialized nations, but in the last decade, there have been outbreaks in North America and Europe among men who have sex with men.

If you were infected via anal intercourse, you may have anal pain, inflammation, and discharge. If you don't treat the infection early, scarring and narrowing (strictures) can develop, which can cause diarrhea and pain with bowel movements. You'll need to take an antibiotic -- usually doxycycline -- for three weeks. You'll also need to notify anyone you've had sex with in the last 60 days, so they can be evaluated and treated.

If the bone is out of alignment -- and likely to limit use of your wrist in the future -- the doctor may be able to straighten your arm nonsurgically before putting it in a splint or cast. If the bone is badly displaced or shattered into many pieces, you may need surgery. Metal pins or a plate and screws may be implanted to set and stabilize the bone. In some cases, the surgeon uses an external fixator – pins attached to a device on the outside of your arm. After surgery or when your cast is off, you may need physical therapy to help restore wrist movement. You can probably return to light activity in a month or two, and to vigorous activity within six months. Full recovery takes about a year.

Your nail may become rigid, green, and brittle. You'll probably need to treat chronic paronychia for several months with topical creams or lotions, and possibly with oral antifungal medication."

Some people develop small bunions, called a bunionette, along the outside of the foot, at the base of the little toe. Wearing tight shoes or high heels make bunions worse. Foot injury, nerve conditions of the foot, abnormal foot bone development at birth, certain types of foot structure, and arthritis can cause bunions. Jobs that put a lot of stress on the joint can also lead to the condition. For example, ballet dancers often get bunions. Early treatment by wearing wide-toed comfortable shoes, padding the bunion, taking anti-inflammatory medication, and using shoe inserts, or orthotics, can often help slow bunion development. Surgery to realign the bones, called a bunionectomy, helps most people with painful, severe bunions."

You may be able to clear up mild Morton's neuroma with self-care strategies like resting the foot, wearing better-fitting shoes, icing and massaging the area, and taking anti-inflammation medication. If it recurs or becomes severe, your doctor may suggest cortisone injections, padding, or shoe inserts. You should continue to treat Morton's neuroma for two months after you stop feeling pain. Surgery to remove a small portion of the nerve or release tissue around it is a last resort, usually for larger neuromas or those that have caused symptoms for a long time. About half of people who have surgery recover within two months."

Hammertoe affects the middle joint in the toe, and mallet toe occurs in the upper toe joint. These deformities usually affect the second toe, but may occur in the other small toes. Poor-fitting shoes, high heels, and shoes that are too small often cause toe problems. Tight shoes squeeze the toes, and over time, tendons and muscles become shorter, keeping the toe in a bent position. Hammertoe and mallet toe can cause toe pain, calluses and corns, and difficulty walking. Splinting, stretching the toe, wearing low-heeled shoes with plenty of toe room, toe exercises, and in severe cases surgery can treat hammertoe and mallet toe."
